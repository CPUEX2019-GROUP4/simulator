# MIPS Simulator
A simiple (but buggy!!!orz) simulator that takes MIPS machine code as input and executes it one by one.
## How to use?
Run ```./sim {{binary}}```
Here, binary is expected to be written in Big Endian (I guess so...).
In case it is in Little Endian, you can first run ```./swap {{binary}} {{output_filename}}```
## Why are you writing this in English?
